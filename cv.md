### About me
I am 22 years old. Last year I graduated from BSEU. After working as an economist for almost a year, I realized that this work does not inspire me. Since I still didn't know what I wanted to connect my life with, I went to a web design course. Over time, I devoted more and more of my time to developing interfaces and safering on behans. 
Then I began to discover more and more interesting things for myself, learned about such a profession as a web developer, went to courses on front-end development. At the moment, I am enjoying what I am doing and the learning process.  
I have good interpersonal communication skills, I love working in a team and I really want to learn and develop new skills. I am a cheerful and reliable person and often look for new responsibilities in various areas of employment.
